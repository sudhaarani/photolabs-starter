# Photolabs
The PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming.

PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts. A pre-existing API is used to build a frontend user experience for users to interact with photos!

## Goal

  * Build a client-side application using the React view-layer library.

## Features
  * A user can view photos from the homepage loaded from the API.
  * The user can navigate to different photo categories, also called topics.
  * The user can click on a photo to view a larger version of the photo and relevant / similar photos.
  * The user can like a photo from anywhere within the application where the photo is displayed.
  * The user can view a heart icon with a notification in the navigation if there are liked photos.
  * The navigation will consist of different topics and heart icon.
  * The client-side application will make API requests to load data.
